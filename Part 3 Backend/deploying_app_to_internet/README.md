# Same Origin policy and CORS
-->The same-origin policy is a security mechanism implemented by browsers in order to prevent session hijacking among other security vulnerabilities.


### Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. Certain "cross-domain" requests, notably Ajax requests, are forbidden by default by the same-origin security policy.


-->In your backend repository, install cors with the command
                Step 1 :npm install cors
